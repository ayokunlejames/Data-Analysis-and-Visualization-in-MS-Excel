# Data Analysis and Visualization in MS-Excel

In this project, I am presented with a Bike Sales Data for analysis and visualization. I am expected to analyze and derive insights from the data and create a dashboard of these insights.

Data  Cleaning: 

- I created a working sheet within the workbook. I checked the data for, and removed duplicates (26 duplicates found and removed, 1000 unique rows retained).
- I standardized the 'Gender" and 'Marital Status" columns.
- I created two new working columns ('Age Bracket' & 'Car Owner') to determine customer age brackets and customer car ownership status. 

Data Analysis:
- After Cleaning the data, i created Pivot tables to generate summary analysis of the data and created appropriate charts to visualize these summary insights.
  
Dashboard Creation:
- I then built a responsive dashboard of insights generated, with slicers to filter the results according to marital status, Region, level of Education, and car ownership status.
